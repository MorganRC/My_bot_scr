When using the bot correctly, follow the instructions below:

File config:
- When creating a telegram bot, take the address of your token and insert it into the TOKEN.

File main.py:
- When starting the scraper, you need to take into account that in the future the bot will use the downloaded file. 
  That is, you should create new files for categories for further loading in the bot.
  If there is only one category, then no changes are required.
  
Telegram Bot was created according to the rules specified in this documentation:
